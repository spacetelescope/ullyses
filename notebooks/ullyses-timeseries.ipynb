    "The Hubble Space Telescopeâ€™s (HST) Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards ([ULLYSES](https://ullyses.stsci.edu/index.html)) program has devoted approximately 1,000 HST orbits to the production of an ultraviolet spectroscopic library of young high- and low-mass stars in the local universe. The ULLYSES team produces several types of High Level Science Products (HLSPs). Products are made using HST, FUSE, and LCO data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the vast majority of data, the ULLYSES team [coadds](https://ullyses.stsci.edu/ullyses-data-description.html#CoaddSpectra) all data of the same instrument and grating combination. However, for targets who exhibit variable flux, coaddition should not be performed. Instead, the ULLYSES team creates [time-series spectra](https://ullyses.stsci.edu/ullyses-data-description.html#hlspFormatTimeSpec), or TSS. "

For this target, there were only 8 contributing spectra, but for the monitoring stars, exposure level TSS can have over 100 contributing spectra. And for sub-exposure TSS, there can be over 700 individual sub-exposures in a single file! Additionally, any manual corrections required for each contributing 1D spectrum (COS/NUV vignetting, STIS defringing, custom extraction, wavelength shifts, etc.) are incorporated in ULLYSES TSS."
